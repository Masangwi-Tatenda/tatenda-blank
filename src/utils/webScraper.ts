He emphasized that care for creation is not just an environmental issue but a matter of justice, highlighting that the poor suffer most from ecological degradation.</p><p>The Pontiff urged wealthy nations to recognize their ecological debt to developing countries and to limit their consumption of non-renewable energy. He also stressed the need for individuals to adopt more sustainable lifestyles, noting that small daily actions can have a significant cumulative impact.</p><p>This address comes ahead of the COP28 climate conference, where Vatican representatives are expected to push for more ambitious climate targets and increased support for vulnerable communities already facing the effects of climate change.</p>",
