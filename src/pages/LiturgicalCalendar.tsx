                      <p>
                        The liturgical year, also known as the church year or Christian year, consists of the cycle of 
                        liturgical seasons in Christian churches that determines when feast days, including celebrations 
                        of saints, are to be observed, and which portions of Scripture are to be read either in an annual 
                        cycle or in a cycle of several years.
                      </p>
                      
                      <h3>Structure of the Liturgical Year</h3>
                      
                      <p>
                        The Catholic liturgical year is divided into several seasons, each with its own focus and character:
                      </p>
                      
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Advent</strong> - Four Sundays before Christmas, beginning the liturgical year</li>
                        <li><strong>Christmas</strong> - From Christmas Eve until the Baptism of the Lord</li>
                        <li><strong>Ordinary Time (First Part)</strong> - Between Christmas and Lent</li>
                        <li><strong>Lent</strong> - Forty days before Easter, beginning on Ash Wednesday</li>
                        <li><strong>Sacred Paschal Triduum</strong> - Holy Thursday, Good Friday, Holy Saturday</li>
                        <li><strong>Easter</strong> - Fifty days from Easter Sunday to Pentecost</li>
                        <li><strong>Ordinary Time (Second Part)</strong> - From after Pentecost until Advent</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <h3>Liturgical Colors</h3>
                      
                      <p>
                        The Catholic Church uses five main colors for its liturgical vestments and decorations:
                      </p>
                      
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Green</strong> - Used during Ordinary Time, symbolizing hope and growth in faith</li>
                        <li><strong>Purple/Violet</strong> - Used during Advent and Lent, symbolizing penance, preparation, and sorrow</li>
                        <li><strong>White/Gold</strong> - Used during Christmas and Easter, and for feasts of the Lord, Mary, and saints who were not martyrs, symbolizing purity, joy, and glory</li>
                        <li><strong>Red</strong> - Used on Palm Sunday, Good Friday, Pentecost, and feasts of martyrs, symbolizing the Holy Spirit and martyrdom</li>
                        <li><strong>Rose</strong> - Used on the Third Sunday of Advent (Gaudete Sunday) and the Fourth Sunday of Lent (Laetare Sunday), symbolizing joy amid a season of penance</li>
                      </ul>

                          The liturgical calendar is designed to sanctify time itself, making each day and season an opportunity to encounter Christ and the mysteries of salvation throughout the year.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      
                      <h3>Reading Cycles</h3>
                      
                      <p>
                        The Church follows a three-year cycle (A, B, C) for Sunday readings:
                      </p>
                      
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Year A</strong> - Primarily from the Gospel of Matthew</li>
                        <li><strong>Year B</strong> - Primarily from the Gospel of Mark</li>
                        <li><strong>Year C</strong> - Primarily from the Gospel of Luke</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p>
                        Readings from the Gospel of John appear in all three years, especially during the Easter season.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                        Weekday readings follow a two-year cycle (I, II) for the first reading, while the Gospel readings remain the same each year.
                      </p>
