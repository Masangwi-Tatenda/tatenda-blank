        <h2>First Holy Communion</h2>
        <p>
          First Holy Communion is a sacred event in the life of a Catholic child when they receive the 
          Eucharist for the first time. The Eucharist is the sacrament in which Catholics receive the Body 
          and Blood of Jesus Christ. Catholics believe that through the consecration of the bread and wine, 
          these elements truly become the Body and Blood of Christ, while retaining the appearance of bread and wine.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
          "I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. 
          This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." 
          <footer>â€” John 6:51</footer>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
          First Communion is an important milestone in a child's spiritual journey and a significant step in their 
          initiation into the Catholic Church, following Baptism and preceding Confirmation.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">What is the appropriate age for First Communion?</h4>
                <p>
                  In our parish, children typically receive First Communion in second grade (around age 7-8), 
                  which is considered the age of reason. However, we accommodate children of various ages and 
                  special circumstances.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">What should my child wear for First Communion?</h4>
                <p>
                  First Communion is a special occasion, and children traditionally dress in their best attire. 
                  Girls typically wear white dresses symbolizing purity, often with veils. Boys typically wear 
                  suits or dress shirts with ties. The focus should be on modest, respectful clothing that helps 
                  the child understand the sacredness of the occasion.

                <p>
                  If your child was baptized in another Catholic parish, you will need to provide a copy of their 
                  baptismal certificate. If your child was baptized in another Christian denomination with a valid 
                  baptism (using water and the Trinitarian formula), they will need to make a Profession of Faith 
                  before First Communion. Please discuss this with our Faith Formation Office.

                  Regular attendance is important for proper preparation. If classes are missed, parents should 
                  contact the Faith Formation Office to arrange for make-up work. Excessive absences may require 
                  additional preparation or delay in receiving the sacrament.
