        <h2 className='text-church-burgundy'>What is Baptism?</h2>
        <p>
          Baptism is the first of the seven sacraments and the "door" which gives access to the other sacraments. 
          Baptism is the first and chief sacrament of forgiveness of sins because it unites us with Christ, who 
          died for our sins and rose for our justification. Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist constitute the 
          "sacraments of initiation" by which a believer receives the fullness of grace needed for living the 
          Christian life.
        </p><br></br>
        
        <blockquote>
          "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the 
          Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you." 
          <footer className='text-church-burgundy'>â€” Matthew 28:19-20</footer><br></br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
          Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as children of God; we become members of Christ, 
          are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission.

              <div>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">How old should my child be for Baptism?</h4>
                <p>In the Catholic Church, infants are typically baptized within the first few months of life. However, there is no age limit, and children of any age can be baptized.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">Can we choose any name for our child's Baptism?</h4>
                <p>While parents have freedom in choosing names, the Church encourages including a saint's name or a Christian virtue as part of the child's name to provide a model of Christian life.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">What if one parent is not Catholic?</h4>
                <p>A child can be baptized if at least one parent is Catholic and intends to raise the child in the Catholic faith. The non-Catholic parent should be informed and not object to the child's Catholic upbringing.</p>

              <div>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">How many godparents should a child have?</h4>
                <p>A child must have at least one godparent (sponsor) who is a practicing Catholic. Traditionally, children have two godparents â€“ one male and one female â€“ but this is not required.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">What if a potential godparent cannot attend the Baptism?</h4>
                <p>If a godparent cannot be physically present at the Baptism, they can be represented by a proxy. The godparent's name will still appear in the baptismal record.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div>
                <h4 className="text-lg font-bold text-church-burgundy">Is there a fee for Baptism?</h4>
                <p>Sacraments are gifts from God and are not "sold." However, it is customary to make an offering to the Church. This offering supports the parish's ministry and is not a payment for the sacrament.</p>
