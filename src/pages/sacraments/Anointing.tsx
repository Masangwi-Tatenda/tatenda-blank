        <h2>Anointing of the Sick</h2>
        <p>
          The Sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is administered to bring spiritual and even physical strength during an illness, especially near the time of death. This sacrament was previously referred to as "Last Rites" or "Extreme Unction" but is now more commonly called the Anointing of the Sick, highlighting that it is not limited to those who are dying.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In this sacrament, the Church prays for healing and forgiveness. The priest anoints the sick person with blessed oil and prays, asking God to give strength and comfort to the person suffering from illness.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
          "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord." 
          <footer>â€” James 5:14-15</footer>
        </blockquote>
